Purpose:
Create a tool to create tracks for autonomous SLAM. The user will click on the interface to place down cones to create a track. Cones can be selected to be orange, yellow, or blue. There is an add or erase feature to edit the cones while placing them. The most important function of the program is to store the placement of the cones in relation to the orange cones (starter cones being (0,0) coordinates) and when the user ‘submits’ the program creates a YAML file in the same format as FSG.YAML.
